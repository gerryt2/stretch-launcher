# Example 2 - Single Circuit Connection Manually

StretchSense is a global supplier of soft sensors. These soft sensors are perfect for measuring the complex movements of people and soft objects in our environments. 

## About
### Background
The StretchSense Android API has been developed to demonstrate how to establish a connection between a StretchSense Fabric Evaluation circuit and a BLE enabled Android device. The platform was developed using android Studio 2.1.2 in Java with a gradle defaultConfig minSdkVersion 19 and a targetSdkVersion 22.
This project and additional examples are available on StretchSense's Github Page https://github.com/Stretchsense-Limited.

### Usage
The Single Circuit Connection application demonstrates how to use the StretchSense (Bluetooth LE) Android Library by stepping through the connection process by way of a list of button elements tied to core library functions.

About Buttons:
*   StartScanning: Start scanning for new sensor durring 20 sec
*   Connect: Connect the phone with the sensor scanned

	
The red label at the bottom of the screen is the feedback of the sensor. It let you know the state of connection of the sensor.
